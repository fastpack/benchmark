# Fastpack Benchmarks / Integration Tests

## TL;DR

- All tested bundlers (including fastpack!) think they are faster than they
  really are.
- Fastpack is still the fastest.

## Try it out
```
$ cd basic
$ yarn
$ yarn patch-parcel
$ yarn fastpack:benchmark
$ yarn parcel:benchmark
$ yarn webpack:benchmark
```
